# rfair ![FAIR assessment](https://img.shields.io/badge/FAIR-assessment-118AB2)

> Assess the FAIRness of research data objects, natively in R.

`rfair` is a native R implementation of the
[F-UJI](https://github.com/pangaea-data-publisher/fuji) (FAIRsFAIR
Research Data Object Assessment) metrics. Given a persistent identifier
or URL it resolves the object, harvests metadata from its landing page
and from registries (DataCite, Crossref, GitHub), and scores it against
the FAIRsFAIR metrics ([v0.8](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15045911)
by default) for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and
Reusability.

Unlike the original `rfair` (an HTTP client for an external F-UJI
server), this version performs the **entire assessment in R** — no
Python, no server.

It also goes **beyond F-UJI** with checks that automated FAIR tools
usually miss (prompted by peer review of a COVID-19 FAIR-assessment
study): whether a license actually permits reuse, whether data is
controlled-access / sensitive, and whether identifiers follow best
practices.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("choxos/rfuji")
```

## Quick start

``` r

library(rfair)

a <- assess_fair("https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772")
a
#> <fair_assessment> https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772
#>   resolved: https://zenodo.org/records/8347772
#>   metrics: v0.8 (17 metrics)
#>   FAIR      earned  percent  maturity
#>   F            7/7   100.0%         3
#>   A            7/7   100.0%         3
#>   I            4/6    66.7%         2
#>   R            5/6    83.3%         2
#>   FAIR       23/26    88.5%         2
# (illustrative; exact scores depend on the object's live metadata)

summary(a)            # F/A/I/R score table
as.data.frame(a)      # one row per metric
as_fuji_json(a)       # F-UJI-compatible JSON
as_rdf(a)             # DQV + schema.org Rating (JSON-LD)
```

## Metric versions and F-UJI options

`rfair` bundles the current F-UJI website choices plus release-specific
legacy metric files from upstream F-UJI:

``` r

rfair_metric_versions()
#> 0.8 0.5 0.5ssv2 0.5ss 0.5env 0.7_software ...

assess_fair(
  "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772",
  metric_version = "0.5ssv2",
  use_datacite = TRUE,
  metadata_service_endpoint = "https://example.org/oai",
  metadata_service_type = "oai_pmh"
)
```

Supported metadata service type labels include OAI-PMH, OGC CSW, SPARQL,
DCAT, schema.org JSON-LD, DataCite, Crossref, Signposting, typed links,
RO-Crate, CKAN, and a generic other metadata document option.

## Beyond F-UJI

``` r

# A license can be present yet NOT open for reuse
license_reuse("https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/")$is_open
#> [1] FALSE

# Controlled-access / sensitive data is not a FAIR failure
classify_access(access_level = "closedAccess",
                urls = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/...")$controlled_access
#> [1] TRUE

# Identifier hygiene (layered / non-persistent PIDs)
identifier_hygiene("RRID:MGI:5577054")$issues

# Canonical FAIR principle definitions (go-fair.org / FAIR-nanopubs)
fair_principles("R")
```

These results are attached to every assessment (`a$reuse`, `a$access`,
`a$identifier_hygiene`) and shown in the app.

## Batch assessment and rtransparent

[`assess_fair_batch()`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/reference/assess_fair_batch.md)
scores a vector of identifiers and returns one tidy row per identifier.
[`assess_data_code()`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/reference/assess_data_code.md)
bridges [rtransparent](https://github.com/choxos/rtransparent): it takes
the data and code identifiers rtransparent extracts from articles (its
`open_data_links` and `open_code_links` columns; DOIs, repository URLs,
and identifiers.org `prefix:accession` codes such as `geo:GSE…`) and
scores each, using the FsF data metrics for data and the FRSM software
metrics for code.

``` r

rt <- rtransparent::rt_data_code_pmc(xml)          # is_open_data, open_data_links, ...
scores <- assess_data_code(rt, id_col = "pmid")    # one row per (article, data/code link)
```

[`split_identifiers()`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/reference/split_identifiers.md)
parses the `" ; "`-joined link strings on their own.

## Interactive app

``` r

launch_rfair()   # bslib Shiny app: scores, per-metric report, reuse/access panels
```

A browser version (registry-only, no install) is published at
**<https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/app/>**.

## HTTP API scaffold

`rfair` also ships a Plumber scaffold and OpenAPI contract for teams
that want to expose the same assessment engine over HTTP:

``` r

api <- system.file("plumber", "rfair-api.R", package = "rfair")
pr <- plumber::pr(api)
pr$run(port = 8000)
```

The machine-readable API contract is installed at:

``` r

system.file("openapi", "rfair-openapi.yaml", package = "rfair")
```

## How it works

    id_parse() → resolve → harvest (DataCite JSON · landing-page JSON-LD/Dublin Core/
    OpenGraph · signposting typed links · XML · RDF · GitHub) → merge → 17 metric
    evaluators → F/A/I/R score → fair_assessment

Reference data (SPDX licenses, file formats, access rights, protocols,
metadata standards, FAIR principles, reusabledata.org curations) is
baked in from the F-UJI sources by the scripts in `data-raw/`.

## Citation and metadata

The repository includes `CITATION.cff` and `codemeta.json` so software
harvesters can find rfair’s authorship, license, version, dependencies,
repository URL, and upstream F-UJI provenance. A repository-specific
archived DOI has not yet been minted; once one exists, add it to both
metadata files before the next release.
