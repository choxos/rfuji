# rfair: Assess the FAIRness of Research Data Objects

rfair is a native R implementation of the F-UJI (FAIRsFAIR Research Data
Object Assessment) metrics. Given a persistent identifier or URL, it
resolves the object, harvests metadata from its landing page and from
registries such as DataCite, and scores the result against the FAIRsFAIR
metrics. rfair began as a fork of the rfuji F-UJI API client; unlike
that client, it performs the assessment entirely in R and does not
require a running F-UJI server.
