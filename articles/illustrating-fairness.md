# Illustrating and interpreting a FAIR assessment

This vignette shows how to *read* the output of an assessment: the
scorecard plot, the score tables, the maturity levels, and the
reuse/access context that `rfair` adds on top of the F-UJI metrics. For
how the scores are computed see
[`vignette("methodology")`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/articles/methodology.md);
for a quick tour see
[`vignette("rfair")`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/articles/rfair.md).

So the vignette renders offline and deterministically, it uses the
bundled example assessment `fair_example` (a real assessment of a Zenodo
deposit, ). You produce your own the same way:

``` r

# (needs network) assess any DOI / PID / URL:
x <- assess_fair("https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772")
```

``` r

data(fair_example)
x <- fair_example
x
#> <fair_assessment> https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772
#>   resolved: https://zenodo.org/records/8347772
#>   metrics: v0.8 (17 metrics)
#> 
#>   FAIR     earned  percent  maturity
#>   F           7/7   100.0%         3
#>   A           7/7   100.0%         3
#>   I           4/6    66.7%         2
#>   R           5/6    83.3%         2
#>   FAIR      23/26    88.5%       2.5
#> 
#>   reuse:    open (software, permissive); custom/unknown
```

The printed summary is the fastest read: an earned/total and percentage
per FAIR category, the overall score, and any reuse/access/identifier
flags.

## 1. The scorecard plot

[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) turns the
assessment into a one-glance scorecard. Each bar is a FAIR category
filled to its score, labeled with `earned/total` and its **maturity**
level (the colored word on the right). The dark bar at the top is the
overall FAIR score.

``` r

plot(x)
```

![FAIR scorecard: horizontal bars for Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable, plus an overall FAIR
bar.](illustrating-fairness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

To see *which* of the 17 metrics drive each category, plot the
per-metric breakdown. Bars are grouped and colored by category (F/A/I/R)
and labeled with the metric identifier and its `earned/total`.

``` r

plot(x, type = "metric")
```

![Per-metric FAIR breakdown: one horizontal bar per metric, grouped by
category.](illustrating-fairness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

For a compact overview that shows both levels at once,
`type = "sunburst"` draws a concentric ring chart: the inner ring is the
four FAIR categories and the outer ring is the individual metrics, each
filled in proportion to its score, with the overall FAIR percentage in
the center. This is the same summary the web app shows.

``` r

plot(x, type = "sunburst")
```

![Concentric FAIR sunburst: inner ring of F/A/I/R categories, outer ring
of individual metrics, overall percentage in the
center.](illustrating-fairness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

## 2. Score tables

[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) returns the
per-category table behind the scorecard (handy for reports and further
computation):

``` r

summary(x)
#>   category earned total percent maturity
#> 1        F      7     7  100.00      3.0
#> 2        A      7     7  100.00      3.0
#> 3        I      4     6   66.67      2.0
#> 4        R      5     6   83.33      2.0
#> 5     FAIR     23    26   88.46      2.5
```

[`as.data.frame()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.data.frame.html) gives one
row per metric, with its principle, category, score, maturity, and
pass/fail status:

``` r

df <- as.data.frame(x)
head(df, 8)
#>   metric_identifier principle category
#> 1       FsF-F1-01MD        F1        F
#> 2       FsF-F1-02MD        F1        F
#> 3        FsF-F2-01M        F2        F
#> 4        FsF-F3-01M        F3        F
#> 5        FsF-F4-01M        F4        F
#> 6        FsF-A1-01M        A1        A
#> 7       FsF-A1-02MD        A1        A
#> 8     FsF-A1.1-01MD      A1.1        A
#>                                                                                                                                                     metric_name
#> 1                                                                                                  Metadata and data are assigned a globally unique identifier.
#> 2                                                                                                       Metadata and data are assigned a persistent identifier.
#> 3 Metadata includes descriptive core elements (creator, title, data identifier, publisher, publication date, summary and keywords) to support data findability.
#> 4                                                                                                    Metadata includes the identifier of the data it describes.
#> 5                                                                     Metadata is offered in such a way that it can be registered or indexed by search engines.
#> 6                                                                                             Metadata contains access level and access conditions of the data.
#> 7                                                                                                         Metadata and data are retrievable by their identifier
#> 8                                                                                    A standardized communication protocol is used to access metadata and data.
#>   earned total percent maturity status
#> 1      1     1     100        3   pass
#> 2      1     1     100        3   pass
#> 3      2     2     100        3   pass
#> 4      1     1     100        3   pass
#> 5      2     2     100        3   pass
#> 6      1     1     100        3   pass
#> 7      2     2     100        3   pass
#> 8      2     2     100        3   pass
```

Because it is a plain data frame you can slice it however you like, for
example the metrics that did not earn full marks:

``` r

df[df$earned < df$total, c("metric_identifier", "metric_name", "earned", "total")]
#>    metric_identifier
#> 11        FsF-I2-01M
#> 17      FsF-R1.3-02D
#>                                                                         metric_name
#> 11                                      Metadata uses registered semantic resources
#> 17 Data is available in a file format recommended by the target research community.
#>    earned total
#> 11      0     2
#> 17      0     1
```

## 3. How to read the numbers

- **Score (`earned`/`total`).** Each metric is worth a fixed number of
  points; the category score is the sum of earned over total across its
  metrics, and the overall FAIR score is the sum across all 17 metrics.
- **Percent.** `earned / total * 100`, shown on each bar.
- **Maturity (FAIR level).** A CMMI level from 0 to 3 (`incomplete`,
  `initial`, `moderate`, `advanced`) summarizing *how far up* the
  testing ladder a metric reached. A metric can earn points yet still
  sit at a low maturity if only its easiest test passed. Maturity is the
  colored tag on the category scorecard.
- **A low score is a finding, not a verdict.** A restricted-access or
  unlicensed object can be perfectly legitimate; the score tells you
  what a machine could and could not verify from the metadata.

## 4. The context rfair adds beyond the score

A single FAIR percentage hides *why* an object is or is not reusable.
`rfair` surfaces that separately (see
[`vignette("beyond-fuji")`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/articles/beyond-fuji.md));
the same information is in the assessment object and worth showing
alongside the scorecard.

License **reusability** (not merely presence): a license can be detected
yet not actually permit reuse.

``` r

x$reuse$licenses[[1]][c("license", "category", "rdp_category")]
#> $license
#> [1] "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
#> 
#> $category
#> [1] "open (software, permissive)"
#> 
#> $rdp_category
#> [1] "permissive"
```

Access level and sensitivity flags (a restricted object is not a FAIR
failure, but you should know):

``` r

x$access[c("access", "controlled_access", "sensitive")]
#> $access
#> [1] "public"
#> 
#> $controlled_access
#> [1] FALSE
#> 
#> $sensitive
#> [1] FALSE
```

Identifier hygiene (does the persistent identifier resolve cleanly, no
obvious problems):

``` r

x$identifier_hygiene[c("scheme", "is_persistent", "hygiene_ok")]
#> $scheme
#> [1] "doi"
#> 
#> $is_persistent
#> [1] TRUE
#> 
#> $hygiene_ok
#> [1] TRUE
```

## 5. Exporting the illustration

The assessment serializes for downstream tools.
[`as_fair_json()`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/reference/as_fair_json.md)
emits a payload matching the upstream F-UJI `FAIRResults` schema:

``` r

js <- as_fair_json(x)
substr(js, 1, 220)
#> {
#>   "test_id": "4114fa229002ed3433f77ebd3857888da20b07c6",
#>   "request": {
#>     "object_identifier": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8347772",
#>     "metric_version": "0.8",
#>     "use_datacite": true,
#>     "test_debug": false
#> 
```

[`as_rdf()`](https://choxos.github.io/rfuji/reference/as_rdf.md) emits a
machine-readable rating (W3C DQV plus a schema.org `Rating` as JSON-LD),
suitable for embedding in a landing page:

``` r

rdf <- as_rdf(x)
substr(rdf, 1, 220)
#> [1] "{\n  \"@context\": {\n    \"dcat\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#\",\n    \"dc\": \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\",\n    \"schema\": \"http://schema.org/\",\n    \"dqv\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/dqv#\",\n    \"prov\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\",\n   "
```

## Summary

- `plot(x)` and `plot(x, type = "metric")` are the quickest way to see
  an assessment.
- `summary(x)` and `as.data.frame(x)` give the numbers as tidy tables.
- Read score, percent, and maturity together; treat low scores as
  questions, not verdicts.
- The reuse, access, and identifier-hygiene elements explain the *why*
  behind the number.
